# Prodigy-Infotech-Internship

Welcome to a curated collection of cybersecurity tools developed during my first internship as a cybersecurity student. Each project in this repository represents a practical exploration into different aspects of digital security, designed to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of real-world cybersecurity techniques. Projects inculdes:

- Password Builder & Complexity Checker – Create strong passwords and test their resilience.

- Packet Sniffer – Capture and analyze network traffic to uncover what's flowing through the wires.

- Keylogger – Understand input capture and the importance of endpoint security.

- Image Encrypter – Secure images using custom encryption logic to protect visual data.

- Text Encrypter – Encrypt and decrypt sensitive text information with ease.

These projects are not production-ready tools, but rather educational exercises aimed at expanding my knowledge and experience in cybersecurity.
